To install ROS2 Neotic on Ubuntu 22.04, you need to follow these steps. Note that ROS2 "Neotic" does not exist; the latest distribution is "Humble Hawksbill" for Ubuntu 22.04 as of my last update. Assuming you meant a compatible ROS2 distribution for Ubuntu 22.04, here's how you can install ROS2 Humble.

### Step-by-Step Installation Script for ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04

# Update package index
```
sudo apt update
```
# Install required tools and dependencies
```
sudo apt install -y curl gnupg2 lsb-release
```
# Add the ROS2 GPG key
```
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
# Add the ROS2 repository to sources list
```
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list
```
# Update package index again
```
sudo apt update
```
# Install ROS2 Humble base
```
sudo apt install -y ros-humble-desktop
```
# Source the setup script
```
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
# Install additional ROS2 packages (optional)
 ```
 sudo apt install -y ros-humble-<package-name>
```
# Install colcon for building ROS2 packages

```
sudo apt install -y python3-colcon-common-extensions
```
# Environment setup
```
sudo apt install -y python3-argcomplete
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```
# Verify the installation
```
echo "ROS2 Humble installation completed successfully!"
```


### Verification

After the installation, you can verify the installation by running:
```bash
ros2 --version
```

This command should output the version of ROS2 installed, confirming that the installation was successful. If you need additional packages or specific configurations, you can modify the script accordingly.
