To SSH into an EC2 instance using PuTTY, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install PuTTY:**
   - Download PuTTY from the official website: [PuTTY Download Page](https://www.putty.org/).
   - Install PuTTY on your Windows computer.

2. **Convert PEM to PPK (if needed):**
   - AWS provides a PEM file when you create an EC2 instance. PuTTY uses PPK format for private keys.
   - Open PuTTYgen (installed with PuTTY).
   - Click on "Load" and select the PEM file you downloaded from AWS.
   - Click "Save private key" and save the PPK file.

3. **Open PuTTY and Configure the Session:**
   - Open PuTTY.
   - In the "Host Name (or IP address)" field, enter your EC2 instance's public DNS (e.g., `ec2-12-34-56-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com`).
   - Ensure the "Port" field is set to `22`.
   - Under "Connection type," select `SSH`.

4. **Specify the Private Key for Authentication:**
   - In the PuTTY configuration window, expand the "SSH" section in the left-hand tree and then click on "Auth."
   - Under "Authentication parameters," click "Browse" and select the PPK file you saved earlier.

5. **Save the Session (optional):**
   - To save these settings for future use, go back to the "Session" category in the left-hand tree.
   - In the "Saved Sessions" field, enter a name for this session (e.g., "MyEC2Instance").
   - Click "Save."

6. **Connect to the EC2 Instance:**
   - Click "Open" to initiate the connection.
   - The first time you connect, you may see a security alert about the server's host key not being cached in the registry. Click "Yes" to proceed.
   - When prompted, enter the username. For Amazon Linux, the default username is `ec2-user`. For Ubuntu, itâ€™s `ubuntu`. Other distributions have different default usernames (e.g., `centos` for CentOS, `admin` for Debian).

7. **Start Using the EC2 Instance:**
   - You should now be logged into your EC2 instance.

### Example of Full Configuration:

1. **Convert PEM to PPK:**
   - Open PuTTYgen, click "Load," select your `.pem` file, click "Save private key," and save the `.ppk` file.

2. **PuTTY Configuration:**
   - **Session:**
     - Host Name: `ec2-12-34-56-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
     - Port: `22`
     - Connection type: `SSH`
   - **SSH > Auth:**
     - Private key file for authentication: `[Browse to your .ppk file]`
   - **Save session:** (optional)
     - Saved Sessions: `MyEC2Instance`
     - Click "Save"
   - **Connect:**
     - Click "Open"
     - Username: `ec2-user` (or the appropriate username for your instance)

By following these steps, you should be able to SSH into your EC2 instance using PuTTY.
