## ROS 2 Rolling (Ubuntu Noble 24.04): amd64, arm64

[ROS2 on Ubuntu 24.04](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html#id1)

Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like POSIX. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if you’re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.

```bash
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```

#### Enable required repositories

You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system.

First ensure that the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Then add the repository to your sources list.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

#### Install development tools (optional)

If you are going to build ROS packages or otherwise do development, you can also install the development tools:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
```

#### Install ROS 2

Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

ROS 2 packages are built on frequently updated Ubuntu systems. It is always recommended that you ensure your system is up to date before installing new packages.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

**Desktop Install (Recommended):** ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-rolling-desktop
```

**ROS-Base Install (Bare Bones):** Communication libraries, message packages, command line tools. No GUI tools.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-rolling-ros-base
```

#### Install additional RMW implementations (optional)

The default middleware that ROS 2 uses is Fast DDS, but the middleware (RMW) can be replaced at runtime. See the guide on how to work with multiple RMWs.

#### Setup environment

Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.

```bash
# Replace ".bash" with your shell if you're not using bash
# Possible values are: setup.bash, setup.sh, setup.zsh
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
```

#### Try some examples

If you installed ros-rolling-desktop above you can try some examples.

In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ talker:

```bash
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python listener:

```bash
source /opt/ros/rolling/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```

You should see the talker saying that it’s Publishing messages and the listener saying I heard those messages. This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly. Hooray!

#### Next steps

Continue with the tutorials and demos to configure your environment, create your own workspace and packages, and learn ROS 2 core concepts.

#### Troubleshoot

Troubleshooting techniques can be found [here](#).

#### Uninstall

If you need to uninstall ROS 2 or switch to a source-based install once you have already installed from binaries, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt remove ~nros-rolling-* && sudo apt autoremove
```

You may also want to remove the repository:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt autoremove
# Consider upgrading for packages previously shadowed.
sudo apt upgrade
```
```
