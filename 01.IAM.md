To create a DevOps user with access to EC2 and CloudWatch resources on AWS, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a DevOps IAM User

1. **Log in to AWS Management Console**:
   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Log in with your AWS credentials.

2. **Navigate to IAM**:
   - Go to **Services** and select **IAM** (Identity and Access Management).

3. **Create a New User**:
   - In the left-hand menu, click on **Users**.
   - Click on the **Add user** button.
   - Enter the **User name** (e.g., `devops_user`).

4. **Set User Permissions**:
   - Under **Select AWS access type**, check the box for **Programmatic access** (for CLI, SDK, and API access) and **AWS Management Console access** (for console access).
   - Set a custom password or allow AWS to auto-generate one. If you choose console access, you can enforce a password reset on next login.

5. **Attach Policies to User**:
   - On the **Permissions** page, click on **Attach existing policies directly**.
   - Search for and attach the following policies:
     - **AmazonEC2FullAccess**
     - **CloudWatchFullAccess**

     - To connect to an instance via EC2 Instance Connect, you must have an attached IAM policy that grants the following permissions:
      - **ec2-instance-connect**
      - **ec2:DescribeInstances**
   - Optionally, you can create a custom policy for more fine-grained control (explained below).

6. **Review and Create User**:
   - Review the user details.
   - Click **Create user**.
   - Note down the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** if programmatic access was selected.

### Step 2: Create a Custom IAM Policy (Optional)

If you need to provide more granular permissions, create a custom policy and attach it to the user.

1. **Navigate to Policies**:
   - In the left-hand menu, click on **Policies**.
   - Click **Create policy**.

2. **Define Policy Permissions**:
   - Switch to the **JSON** tab and enter a custom policy. Below is an example policy that grants full access to EC2 and CloudWatch resources:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:*",
                "cloudwatch:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. **Review and Create Policy**:
   - Click **Review policy**.
   - Enter a **Name** (e.g., `DevOpsEC2CloudWatchPolicy`) and **Description**.
   - Click **Create policy**.

4. **Attach the Custom Policy to the User**:
   - Go back to **Users** in the IAM console.
   - Select the newly created user (`devops_user`).
   - Click on the **Permissions** tab.
   - Click **Add permissions**.
   - Select **Attach existing policies directly**.
   - Search for and select your custom policy (`DevOpsEC2CloudWatchPolicy`).
   - Click **Next: Review**, then **Add permissions**.

### Step 3: Verify User Permissions

1. **Log in as the New User**:
   - Log out of your current AWS session.
   - Log in using the **devops_user** credentials.

2. **Verify EC2 and CloudWatch Access**:
   - Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** and ensure you can perform actions such as launching instances.
   - Navigate to the **CloudWatch Dashboard** and ensure you can view and manage CloudWatch resources such as alarms, metrics, and logs.

### Step 4: (Optional) Configure AWS CLI for the DevOps User

If you need to access AWS resources programmatically, configure the AWS CLI using the userâ€™s access keys.

1. **Install AWS CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   pip install awscli --upgrade --user
   ```

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```
   - Enter the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** of the `devops_user`.
   - Set the **Default region name** (e.g., `us-west-2`).
   - Set the **Default output format** (e.g., `json`).

By following these steps, you will create a DevOps user with the necessary permissions to manage EC2 and CloudWatch resources on AWS.
